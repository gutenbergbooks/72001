the Freedom School, has also served as the
editorial writer for the Gazette Telegraph in
Colorado Springs, since 1954. In addition to
several thousand editorials, he has written
numerous articles for the Freeman Magazine,
including: “<em>The Straight Line</em>,” “<em>Jim Leadbetter’s

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ANARCHY">ANARCHY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A <span class="upper-case">rational being</span>, intent upon learning
the nature of liberty or freedom, is confronted
almost at once with innumerable
instances of governmental predation against
liberty.</p>

<p>As the subject of liberty is pursued, the
more frequently and the more persistently
the fact emerges that governments have
been one of the principal opponents if not
the only principal opponent to liberty.</p>

<p>Invariably, this discovery leads the perspiring
seeker after truth to a fork in the
road. Is it possible, the aspirant to libertarian
certainty asks himself, to pursue the end
of the rainbow of liberty into a miasma of
quicksand and uncertainty?</p>

<p>Might I not end at a place where I would
advocate the cessation of all government?
And if I reached such a conclusion, would I
not find myself aligned with the very forces
I sought to oppose in the beginning, namely,
the forces of lawlessness, chaos and anarchy?</p>

<p>At this fork in the road, libertarians hesitate,
some briefly and some for lengthy periods
of time. The choice to be made is a
difficult one. To abandon liberty at this juncture
and to endorse minimal governments as
devices which might prevent license, could
cause the devotee of liberty to endorse the
active enemy of liberty, albeit in small doses.
On the other hand, to pursue liberty to its
logical conclusions might end in an endorsement
of license, The very antonym of liberty.</p>

<p>It is at this juncture that the word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
“anarchy” rears its dreadful visage. It becomes
incumbent upon sincere seekers after
liberty to grapple with this word and to seek
to understand its implications.</p>

<p>Anarchy has very ancient roots. It is not
wholly essential to probe to the last hidden
tendril altho such a probe can be highly instructive.
What does appear to be a necessary
minimal effort, however, is to explore
at least the principal authors of anarchistic
thought with the view to discovering what it
was that motivated these men.</p>

<p>We can begin with William Godwin of
England. Godwin is noteworthy as the
“father of anarchistic communism” (Encyclopaedia
Britannica).</p>

<p>In 1793 he published the first of several
works on this subject entitled, “Inquiry Concerning
Political Justice.” He is probably
most famous as the author of an anarchistic
novel which he named, “Caleb Williams.”</p>

<p>It was Godwin’s thesis that governments
are instruments of eternal bickering and war;
that wars are fought over property; that the
ownership of property privately is the greatest
curse ever to beset the human race. As
a specific example of tyranny in its worst
form, Godwin suggests marriage.</p>

<p>Before we lay the soubriquet “crackpot”
behind his name, let us look at the England
of Godwin’s time to try to find an explanation
for his radical conclusions.</p>

<p>In Godwin’s day (1756-1836) with only
a few minor exceptions, all property was
owned by the nobility, which is to say by
the persons favored by government. The
common people owned little save the shirts
on their backs. As for marriage, women were
chattels, given by a male parent to another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
male, during a governmentally approved
ceremony. The idea of one person actually
owning and controlling another, which we
would call slavery, and which Godwin saw
as the marriage state, was repellent to him.
He insisted that females were human beings
and as such had as much right to individuality
as males.</p>

<p>To cure the malady, which Godwin saw as
ownership of property, the early Briton recommended
an abolition of governments. It
was the government which sanctified and
protected property rights, even in marriage.
To return to a state of nature (see Rousseau)
governments would have to be abolished.</p>

<p>Be it noted to Godwin’s credit that he
despised violence. And in this position he
is far removed from both the true communist
and the anarchists of action who followed
him.</p>

<p>The next anarchist to be examined is
Pierre Joseph Proudhon of Bexancon, France
(1809-1865). Proudhon drank deeply from
Godwin’s well and came forward with certain
modifications and extensions of the
Godwin doctrine.</p>

<p>Proudhon acknowledged a debt of gratitude
to both Plato and Thomas More, a pair
of dedicated socialists (see Plato’s “Republic”
and More’s “Utopia”) and busied himself
with some practical means for implementing
the socialist dream.</p>

<p>Like his precursors, he was fundamentally
opposed to property ownership. His
most famous work, “Qu’est-ce que La Propriete?”
(“What Is Property?”), got him into
immediate difficulties with the government.
Proudhon, in this opus, declared that “property
is robbery” and set about outlining a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
social order in which no property could be
privately owned.</p>

<p>The Encyclopedia Americana says that
Proudhon was the “first to formulate the
doctrines of philosophic anarchism.”</p>

<p>It is probably true that there are no better
writings extant extolling individualism as
opposed to collectivism than Proudhon’s
early essays. Yet, it should be recalled that
Proudhon’s aim, in addition to a society
free of governmental coercion, was a state
in which property as a private device was
abolished.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to recall that Karl
Marx was deeply moved by Proudhon’s arguments.
The first of Proudhon’s writings
appeared in print in 1840 and formed the
basis of Marx’s first expostulations which
appeared in 1842. Shortly thereafter, Marx
veered away from Proudhon’s individualism
and contrived his concept of collectivism as
the natural and the inevitable course of history.</p>

<p>Marx, however, was never an anarchist,
despite the well-known phrase frequently attributed
to him that in time the government
of the proletariat would simply “wither
away.” This phrase should properly be attributed
to Lenin.</p>

<p>However, it is known that Marx did make
an attempt to lure the anarchists of France
into the first “Internationale” and was
hooted down for his pains. The anarchists
of that time were shrewd enough to sense
that the enlargement of government into a
general holding company for all property,
would never result in the abolition of private
ownership of property. Rather, it would
result in the perpetuation of a privileged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
class of persons who would have possession
of the property to the exclusion of all others,
the very contingency the anarchists
sought to avoid. And since the aim of the
anarchists was to eliminate exclusive ownership,
they could not agree to the Marxist
arguments respecting the usefulness of a
government as the repository of all property.</p>

<p>We pass from Proudhon to another noteworthy
anarchist, the Russian Prince Peter
Alexeivich Kropotkin (1842-1921). In his
hands, the doctrine of anarchism took on
an international aspect. In point of fact he
added little to either Godwin or Proudhon,
except the more grandiose concept of a
world order. He suggested that ALL governments
must be overthrown either peacefully
or in any other manner after which “the
present system of class privilege and unjust
distribution of the wealth produced by labor
that creates and fosters crime” would be
abolished.</p>

<p>It was Kropotkin who endeavored to preserve
the ideals of a property-less society
after the most exciting and destructive of all
the anarchists had done his work. This was
Michael Bakunin (1814-1876). Bakunin
took his ideology both from Proudhon and
from Marx and endeavored to unite the objectives
of the former with the methods of
the latter.</p>

<p>Bakunin despaired of bringing about a
state of universal property-less-ness by
means of education and propaganda. So did
Marx. Marx declared that those who owned
property would never give it up without a
struggle. This idea entranced Bakunin. He
devised what was to be called “propaganda
of action.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>It was Bakunin’s contribution to anarchistic
methods that persons who held governmental
offices should be assassinated while
they held office. Such assassination, he argued,
would have a persuasive effect upon
future politicians. If the offices could be
made sufficiently dangerous and risky, there
would be few who would care to hazard
their necks in such unrewarding positions.
The answer to the force of government, according
to Bakunin, was the force of non-government.
As an educational device, a
thrown bomb was considered to be the final
argument.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to embroider the result.
The peaceful arguments of Proudhon and
Godwin went by the boards as anarchists
rallied to Bakunin’s banner. Beginning in
1878 there was a series of assassinations and
attempted assassinations against the heads
of governments.</p>

<p>Germany’s Emperor William had a narrow
escape and so did the German princes
in 1883. In 1886 in Chicago, a bomb explosion
in the Haymarket killed a number
of persons. In the resulting hysteria, seven
arrests were made, all of persons known to
be teaching anarchy. Four were hanged, two
drew life sentences, and one was imprisoned
for 15 years. No one to this day is certain
who threw the bomb.</p>

<p>Anarchists were pictured in cartoons as
bearded radicals carrying smoking bombs.
President Carnot of France was assassinated
in 1894. The Empress Elizabeth of Austria
was assassinated in 1898. King Humber of
Italy was assassinated in 1900. President
McKinley was assassinated in 1901.</p>

<p>But Bakunin’s enthusiasm wrecked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
anarchist movement despite all Kropotkin
could do to save the fragments. These excesses,
which have even been repeated in
modern times, have had the effect of uniting
public opinion against anything that smacks
of anarchy.</p>

<p>There were, of course, other anarchists.
Some have credited Rousseau, and some
even Zeno with the actual birth of the idea
of a property-less society. But the four men
briefly reviewed here, with the possible additions
of Elisee Reclus and the American,
Benjamin R. Tucker, made the major contributions
to anarchist doctrine. There is no
serious cleavage in anarchist ranks.</p>

<p>It is these thoughts which must confront
the libertarian as he seeks to understand the
meaning of individualism, liberty, property,
and so on.</p>

<p>But in complete candor, the sincere libertarian
cannot be called an anarchist whichever
fork of the road he elects to pursue. It
must be recalled that without exception, anarchists
wished to do away with private ownership
of property. Some advocated peaceful
means ending the abolition of government.
Some advocated violent means by destroying
politicians in government. But by any yardstick
employed, and whether we are speaking
of “philosophic anarchists” or “anarchistic
communists,” the central aim of the
anarchist movement was to eliminate private
ownership. The reduction of the government
to zero was simply, to them, a necessary first
step.</p>

<p>In contrast, the libertarian is a better
economist. From first to last he is in favor
of private ownership. It is, in fact, the
abuses of private ownership inflicted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
government which arouse the most ardent
libertarians.</p>

<p>If we take the “communist” anarchists, we
are confronted with violence as a means to
abolish private ownership with the abolition
of government as the first step. If we
take the “philosophic” anarchists, we are
confronted with essays on individualism and
the desire to do away with private ownership
by means of the elimination of government.</p>

<p>The aim of the anarchist is to eliminate
private ownership. The libertarian is dedicated
to the perpetuation and the full enjoyment
of private ownership.</p>

<p>Never could two doctrines be more in opposition.</p>

<p>The most constructive of the anarchists
were, socially speaking, individualists, peaceful
and harmless. The least constructive,
socially speaking, were dedicated to the
overthrow of force by counter force. But
without exception, in the realm of economics,
every anarchist comes unglazed.</p>

<p>In brief, let us define the anarchist as a
political individualist and an economic socialist.
In contrast, the libertarian can be
defined as an individualist, both politically
and economically.</p>

<p>As the libertarian approaches or hesitates
at the fork in the road, one direction seems
to him to indicate anarchy and the other, an
advocacy of coercion in minor doses. But,
on careful analysis, the branch which seems
to carry the banner “anarchy” does no such
thing.</p>

<p>The libertarian, however he mulls over
this dilemma to his progress, is not concerned
with government. His concern is with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
liberty. He is not opposed to government. He
favors freedom. The libertarian wishes to
preserve all human rights, among which and
predominantly among them is the right to
own property privately and to enjoy it fully.</p>

<p>The libertarian is a champion of individualism.
He is an advocate of tools which can
perform certain functions for him. He has
no objection to the formation of any kind
of tool that will assist him to protect his
rights or his property. But he cannot brook
the forceful compulsive tool which he is
compelled to pay for when he has no use
for it.</p>

<p>He has no objection to policemen whose
function is solely that of protection. But he
resists the supposition that others know better
than he, how much protection he needs
or can afford.</p>

<p>He sees in government a tool of man’s
devising. He has no objection to this tool
so long as it is totally responsive to the man
who hires the tool and pays for its use. He
does object to the employment of this tool
by some against others in an aggressive
manner, since he is primarily concerned
with human liberty and the preservation of
it for all individuals.</p>

<p>But it is destructive of libertarian aims
and objectives to label a seeker after total
freedom with the opprobrium of “anarchist.”</p>

<p>Economically speaking, all anarchists are,
socialists, however they may coalesce to the
political spectrum. Economically speaking,
the libertarian is an individualist, believing
in and supporting the concept of private
ownership, individual responsibility and self-government.</p>
